# SYSC 3020 Term Project — Starter Repository

This is the **read-only starter** for the SYSC 3020 term project, based on the
open-source Java game **SERG-Delft/jpacman**. Every team works the same subset —
the **JPacman core game logic** (packages `board`, `level`, `npc`, `points`;
UI/sprite out of scope). Read the assignment handout and the **Project Overview**
on Brightspace for full details.

## What's inside

- `src/…` — the JPacman game code (read it and build it).
- `scripts/llm_req_review.py` — the LangChain reviewer skeleton you complete.
- `TEAM_CHARTER.md`, `AI_USAGE.md` — templates to fill in.
- `templates/` — blank templates to copy from.
- `doc/scenarios.md` — the game's expected behaviour.

## How to use it

**Download or clone this repository** (read-only) to read and build the code and
to complete `scripts/llm_req_review.py`. Do your work locally and **submit your
files as a `.zip` on Brightspace**.

## Building the game
./gradlew build # compile + run the tests — needs JDK 11


JPacman is self-contained (no companion libraries). If the build fails, first
check that you are on **JDK 11**.
